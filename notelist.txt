e.g
function(name,age,course)
when i call profile i should print the name age course

Python loops

for loops; 
           They execute a block of code a fixed number of times. 
           It can be used to iterate over objects.
           it can be used when the number of iterations are known.
           It extecutes only sequences,strings& range
To skip an iteration in loop we use  continue and to end over / terminate aloop we use break 

NOTE; Continue helps us to remove an iterated value when it reaches it and then continues with others. 
      Break helps use to stop the loop when it reaches the value of iteratable

While Loops;
            These execute a some code while the condition is True
            and the loop while terminate or stop once the condition is False
            



docstring : its read by the interpreter e.g
'''Hello my people its Homebase'''  

comment : it is ignored by the interpreter
e.g  #My files

\n : it means next line
f"Name:{name}"

DATA STRUCTURES
list & the operations
Dict
Tuples
2D arrys


the default value of return is None


function definition
def greeting (name,age):
    print("Name" :,name)  


4th June 2024

#If statements
it has the true & false side{statements}
implicit : used without else
explicit : used with else to print


if elif:
it is used for multiple statements.
NOTE : we dont use switch but we used match



range(start,end,Steps)
continue and brek


sould be a function 

tomorrow
range 
mainn
lambda
split
join


map function
its used as a for loop but it does not replace the for loop



DATA STRUCTURES
Scalar    Vs    Vectors
    {numbers,    {Dict,
    strings,      Lists,
    floats,       Sets,
    boolean}   :   Tuples}


Data Science concepts using pandas

-Data collection
-Data cleaning
-Data analysis
-Data statistics
-Data visualisation

NOTE : To create a data frame we use a class in the in built functions
       A class in built in functions is capitalizied & amethod is not 


csv -comma separated values
json -java script objection notation


arrays used to create dataframe
series used to create objects

List of Projects to be done
-Create a group Repository (add yourself ,your team mate,and the the teacher)--Create two branches (elton&Joel)and push to the main branch
and name it Python-Class-Group-A 
Note : Each indivdual should choose a project to perform and ensure daily commit to your Git Hub


Project to take ;

-Music app  {where users could enter their age & predict their style of music}& 
 get asample of json file of music and trian your model basing on age & reasons & PLOT GRAPHS
-Weather app; {record old weather analysis ,predict future  }
-Banking app  {where users can withdraw & deposit ,get feed bank and determine finacail situation}
-Betting app {record how teams have been playing(historical data) and predict the winning & relagated teams }
-Students manamgement system 
-Supermarket display model 
-Smart city model
