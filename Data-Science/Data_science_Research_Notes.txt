Topic :Data Science;

Data science is exploring & finding data(its a raw fact) in the real world and use the knowledge to solve business problems.  
like Service planning, Customer prediction.  
OR 
Data science is a multidisciplinary feild that   uses scientific methods , process,
algorithms and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and unstructed data

NOTE:This involes data collection ,cleaning,analyse and vizualisation

Why python is highly used in data science?
It is widely used because of its;
-Simpilcity
-Readability
-Available of Free packages


  
#Basics of Data Analysis.
-Python learning
-Python installation


#Python Labraries. 
1-Pandas   >for data manipaltion and analysis
2-Numpy    >For numeric operations
3-Sicpy    >For scientific and data computation
4-Matiplotlib  >For data visualisation 
5-Scikit-Learn  >For general machine learning
6-OS
7-Beautiful Soup  >For web scraping
8-Tensorflow     >For deep learning
9-Networkx & I graph
10-Jupyter Notebook >For analysis and data visualisation


#Exploratory Analysis Using Pandas
-Introdction to Series and Data Frames
-Loan prediction problem

#Data Wrangling Using Pandas

#Building a Predictive Model Using Scikit-Learn

Machine Learning 
    -   ML is a subset of AI that focuses on the algorithms and satistical model 
that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on agiven data


Python for Machine Learning
-It has avariety of frame works 


Artificial Intelligence(AI)
   - This is a broad feild that involes the simulation or resemblance of human Intelligence
    {it is like mimicing human Intelligence}

It includes the following process
-Learning
-Reasoning
-Problem Solving
-Perception (way AI sees things or data)
-Languages understanding


Artificial Intelligence(AI) Labraries
-PyTorch    >For neural networks and deep learning
-Tensorflow
-OpenCV
-NLTK   >For Natural Language Processing


            Difference.
Data Science   : Extracting data
Deep Learning  : learning and Training the model 
Artificail Intelligence : Resemble human thinking
