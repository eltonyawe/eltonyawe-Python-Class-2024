Machine Learning
        Is a sub set of AI that focuses on the development of algorithms and satistical models 
        enableing computers to perform specific tasks without instrustions (Human intervention)

Note:
    It involves training a model on a dataset to make predicts or decisions basing on new data        
    An algorithm aset of instrustion /code that excutes 


Key Concepts in  machine Learning
    -Supervised Learning e.g type& examples
    -Unsupervised Learning 
    -Reforced Learning  (Deep Learning)

    
Supervised Learning (SL)
    -Here the model is trained on a labeled dataset
     *This means that each training is pair with an output label

     Types/Catergories of SL are;
        -Regression SL *This involes predicting continuous output e.g predicting the prices of houses
        -Classification SL *This involes training a distrete(DESIRED OUTPUT) output e.g spamm detection in email
    
    Examples of SL;
                        e.g -Logistics 
                            -Linear Regression
                            -Support vector machines
                            -Decision trees  >
                            -Random forests
                            -Neural Networks


Unsupervised Learning (USL)
        -Here the model is trained on data without labeled responses.
        The system tries to learn the pattrens & the structure from the data


        Types of USL
            -Clustering :Grouping data points into clusters (groups of datasets)
            -Asscoition : Discovering rules thst describe large portins of data

        Examples are;
            - K-means Clustering
            - Mechinical Clustering
            -Principal Component analysis (PCA)
            -Apriori alogorthim


K-means ->It is an algorithm used for clustering, data that has nearrest mean
it stands for cen

#Steps involed when operating with USL
    -Initialize centriods(K)
    -Assigning clusters
    -Update 
    -Repeat the same proccedure until the maxmium cluster set has reached/satisfied


Advantages of K-means
-it is simple and easy to implent
-It works well with seperated values
-Efficient with large dataset

Disadvantages of K-means
-It requires specifing large cluster
-It is sensitive to the position of data
-It assumes that your data is similar in size

(PCA)Principal Component Analysis 
            -It is used to reduce the number of features in the dataset
            It transforms data into a new coordinated system


Steps involved in when implenting PCA 
    -Standardize the data (subtract the mean &  divde it by the std for each feature)
    -Calculate the Matrix
    -Compute the values
    -Sort the values and Vectors
    -Project the data
    
     


Reinforcement Learning;
    -Is the type of machine learning where an agent(Components/Hardware) learns to make decisions by performing actions 
     in an envirnment with aim of a reward.


    Key Concepts in Reinforcement Learning
    -Agent : Learner or Decision maker
    -Environment : This is the external system with which the agent interacts with 
    -State : It is current represention of the current situation of the agent
    -Actions : These are possible movees an agent can make
    -Reward : This could be the feed back from the environment bsaed on the action the agent has taken
    -Policy(py) : This is the strategy/ways the agent uses or employs to determine
      the next action based on the current state
    - Value(V) It is a function the estimates the expected accumulative reward 
     of taking action from a given data

    Types OF Reinforcement Learning
    1.Model-free RL
    2.Model -Based RL

    Algorithims used in relagated
    - Q-Learning
    - Deep Q-Networks (DQN)
    - Policy Gradient Methods
    - Actor-Critic Methods
