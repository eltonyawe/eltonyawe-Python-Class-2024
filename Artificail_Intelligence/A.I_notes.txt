ARTIFICAIL INTELLIGENCE
What is A.I ?
    Definiton:
    >This is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines especailly computer systems
    >This process includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction

Goals of A.I 
    To create systems that can perform tasks would normally require human intelligence
        -Visaul Perception
        -Speech Perception
        -Decision Making 
        -Language Translation

History of A.I 
    *1950 ->Neraul Networks
    *1960's ->Development of algorithms
    *1980's ->Developed (DL>Deep Learning)
    *2000 ->Machine Learning and  Huge / big data

Types of A.I 
    1.Narrow A.I (Weak A.I) 
        -This is the A.I that is developed and trained for particular task e.g voice assistants
    2.General A.I (Strong A.I )
        -This is the A.I that has the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge across similar to human intelligence
    3.Superintelligence A.I 
        -It is an hypothatical A.I that surposses human intelligence and capabilities


A.I  Vs ML  Vs  DL
-A.I is a broad field encompassing any technique that enables machine to mimic the human intel 
-ML is a subset of A.I that involves development & use of algorithms to learn and make predictions
-DL is a subset of ML that  uses neural networks withmany layers to analyse various info


Artificial Intelligence Subfields
    1. Natural Language Processing(NLP) C
        -Techniques for understanding and generating human Language
        -Applications: Chatbots, Sentiment analysis, Language translation, Speech recognition

    2.Computer Vision 
        -Techniques for enabling machines to interprete and make decisions based on Vision
        -Applications: Image & Video Recognition ,Self Driving Cars and Medical Imaging

    3.Robotics 
        -The design and creation of robots that can perform tasks autonomously
        -Application: Manfacturing Robots, Autonomous Drones, Household Robots

    4.Expert Systems 
        -A.I systems that emulate the decision-making or ability of a human expert 
        -Components of Expert Systems : Knowledage based, User interface, Inference engine
        -Appilcations: Medical diagnosis systems, finacail forecasting
