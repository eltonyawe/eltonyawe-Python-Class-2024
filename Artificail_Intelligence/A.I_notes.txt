ARTIFICAIL INTELLIGENCE
What is A.I ?
    Definiton:
    >This is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines especailly computer systems
    >This process includes learning, reasoning, and self-correction

Goals of A.I 
    To create systems that can perform tasks would normally require human intelligence
        -Visaul Perception
        -Speech Perception
        -Decision Making 
        -Language Translation

History of A.I 
    *1950 ->Neraul Networks
    *1960's ->Development of algorithms
    *1980's ->Developed (DL>Deep Learning)
    *2000 ->Machine Learning and  Huge / big data

Types of A.I 
    1.Narrow A.I (Weak A.I) 
        -This is the A.I that is developed and trained for particular task e.g voice assistants
    2.General A.I (Strong A.I )
        -This is the A.I that has the ability to understand, learn and apply knowledge across similar to human intelligence
    3.Superintelligence A.I 
        -It is an hypothatical A.I that surposses human intelligence and capabilities


A.I  Vs ML  Vs  DL
-A.I is a broad field encompassing any technique that enables machine to mimic the human intel 
-ML is a subset of A.I that involves development & use of algorithms to learn and make predictions
-DL is a subset of ML that  uses neural networks withmany layers to analyse various info

Neraul networks 
Deep Learning 


Neural networks are machine learning models that mimic the way the human brain works 

-They are composed of interconnected nodes or artificial neurons.
-Each node or neuron has a weighted connection with other nodes.
-The output of each neuron is decided by an activation function.
-The network relies on training data to learn and improve over time.

Neural networks are used for various tasks, including:
- Predictive modeling
- Adaptive control
- Facial recognition
- Handwriting recognition
- General game playing
- Generative AI

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses neural networks to analyze data .
    >It uses multiple layers, including input layers, output layers, and hidden layers, 
 to learn increasingly abstract and composite representations of the data . 

Deep learning has been used in many applications like; 
    -Computer vision
    -Natural language processing
    -Speech recognition 
    -Game playing 


    Some common deep learning architectures include;
     -Deep neural networks
     -Deep belief networks
     -Recurrent neural networks
     -Transformers
