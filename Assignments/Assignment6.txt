QN ; How to call a function
    In Python, you define a function with the def keyword, then write the function identifier (name) followed by parentheses and a colon. The next thing you have to do is make sure you indent with a tab or 4 spaces
and then specify what you want the function to do for you.

    You call the function by typing its name and putting a value in parentheses. 
This value is sent to the function's parameter. e.g.  def boys (name,age): is a funiction parameter.


# Steps take create and call afunction with return
  The function name is followed by parameter(s) in (). 
  The colon : signals the start of the function body, which is marked by indentation.
  Inside the function body, the return statement determines the value to be returned.
  After function definition is complete,calling the function with an argument returns a value.

NOTE; Return block the cal for function arguements and prints out the value of on the terminal.
