#2D_Arrays

What is a Two-Dimensional Arry?

       A two dimensional array is an array within an array OR an array of arrays. 
It is also known as a collection of data elements arranged in a grid-like structure with rows and columns.
Each element in the array is referred to as a cell and can be accessed by its row and column indices/indexes.
NOTE:An array is also called a list according to python programming.


#Example of a 2D array..e.g.a Numpad keybutton Case
Num_pad =[[1,2,3,],
          [4,5,6],
          [7,8,9],
          ["*",0,"#"]]
print(Num_pad)
  ''it will print this on terminal'   [[1,2,3,],[4,5,6],[7,8,9],["*",0,"#"]]


for loop in Num_pad :
    for Num_pad_og in loop :
        print(Num_pad_og,end=" ")
    print()
     
'it will print this on terminal'  1 2 3
                                  4 5 6
                                  7 8 9 
                                  * 0 #     


#Switch Case
           Switch Case in Python is a mulit-way decision statement similar to Python "if-else"
The switch expression is first evaluated and then compared to each case. 
If there is a match, the associated block of code is executed.
   QN: What is the difference between switch case and if-else in Python?
An if-then-else statement can test expressions based on ranges of values or conditions while
A switch statement tests expressions based only on a single integer, enumerated value, or String object.

The switch(2+3) is evaluated and the integral value obtained is 5,
which is then compared one by one with case labels and a matching label is found at case 5:
So, printf(“2+3 makes 5”) is executed and then followed by break which brings the control out of the switch statement.
NOTE : Switch case is only used in "dictionaries" according to Python because it replaces or works as if elif-else statement to prevenet over typing.
#Examples
def switch (value) :{
    case "One" :
    reurn 1    ;
    case "Two" :
    return 2   ;
    case"three":
}
    return 3
